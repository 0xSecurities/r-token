# Regulated Token (r-token) System

Smart Contracts to enfore trade approval

## Abstract

The Regulated Token System is a general purpose ERC-20 token implementation that overrides token transfer methods to consult an on-chain database for trade approval.  It is designed to be programmed with simple rules that can be turned off and on by regulators that maintain regulatory compliance in various jurisdictions around the world.  Whereas most issuers create unique token smart contracts with small tweaks, the Regulated Token System is designed to be a flexible standard for issuing regulated securities without code modification usable by any issuer.
